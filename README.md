# pySankey

Python Script for Tangerine bank data(CSV) into a txt file which can be visualized cleanly with "https://sankeymatic.com/build/".

Must have `pandas` installed(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html). In order to run:

```python
python Flow.py
```

After running you will be prompted to enter a path to a CSV from Tangerine, after that it will produce a `data.txt` file and then you can take that file and enter it into "https://sankeymatic.com/build/" to have a nice visualization of your expenses.

NOTE: This only works with Tangerine bank data at that moment.
